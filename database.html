                <h4>A structured set of data</h4>
                <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating,
                    manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of
                    databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational
                    database or a non-relational database. Relationships means a set of our
                    data is related to another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-
                    relational database there is not a common related section of our data. our
                    databases are put into sections of data called schemas, inside each schema
                    each data set is organized into tables, those tables contain columns and
                    rows to house that particular set of data.</p>

            <p>All databases are just a bin of storage.
                This storage is housed on your
                harddrive, often times large companies
                will have floors upon floors of just
                database storage (think NSA styled).
                Our computer stores information on
                the harddrive, we are able to creat
                new information, read information,
                update information and delete
                information.</p>

            <p>Since there could potentially be a lot
                of information a database stores one
                probelm we might run into is finding
                the data we are looking for. Imagine
                we had a room full of books and you
                were asked to find the Coding Dojo
                Algorithm book. well you might start
                picking up each book, checking the
                title and moving onto the next until
                you found it. thats very slow as most
                libraries discovered. Instead if we
                were to ID each item we can find it
                quickly.</p>

            <p>The amazing part about having a
                Database is that it is a storage bin that
                holds onto all saved data. Well if only
                one user had access to that data its just
                like what we have built into our own
                computer, it wouldn't be useful to
                other user. However the joy of having
                a database is that it is a storage bin
                many users can interact with, creating,
                reading, updating, and deleting
                information that all users would see.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of large companies that
                specialize in the storing of
                information. As Big Data has erupted
                so too have the size and amount of
                companies on the market. That being
                said a lot of their software is free for
                most users, think of MySQL, which
                while being an incredible DB is
                completely free of cost and is used by
                a large company called Facebook.</p>
